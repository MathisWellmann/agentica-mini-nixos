Licensor: Symbolica AI, Inc. (“Symbolica”)
Licensed Work: The “Simple Agentica” software, platform, SDK, APIs, example projects, and documentation made available by Symbolica for educational use (the “Licensed Work”).
Licensee: The individual student or academic staff member who is granted access to the Licensed Work (“you”).

1. Grant of License

Subject to the terms of this License, Symbolica grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to:

(a) access and use the Licensed Work;  
(b) copy and modify the Licensed Work; and  
(c) create derivative works based on the Licensed Work,

in each case solely for Non-Commercial Academic Use (defined below).

2. Non-Commercial Academic Use

“Non-Commercial Academic Use” means use that is:

(a) for teaching, coursework, assignments, capstone projects, academic research, or personal learning; and  
(b) not intended to, and does not, generate direct or indirect commercial advantage, revenue, or other business benefit for you or any third party.

Without limiting the foregoing, the following are NOT permitted under this License:

(i) using the Licensed Work or any derivative work in any paid product, paid service, consulting engagement, or internal business system of a company or other organisation;  
(ii) offering or operating the Licensed Work (or any derivative work) as a hosted or managed service for others;  
(iii) using the Licensed Work to develop or run systems that support commercial operations, paid clients, or production workloads;  
(iv) including the Licensed Work in software or services that are sold, licensed, or otherwise commercially monetised in any way.

If you wish to make any commercial use, you must obtain a separate commercial licence from Symbolica.

3. Distribution and Access

3.1 You may share copies and modifications of the Licensed Work with:

(a) instructors, teaching assistants, and students in the same course or academic programme; and  
(b) collaborators on an academic research project,

provided that all such use remains Non-Commercial Academic Use and all recipients are informed that their use is subject to this License.

3.2 You may not publicly redistribute the Licensed Work in a way that makes it generally available outside your academic environment (for example, by publishing the full Simple Agentica source code to a public GitHub repository) without Symbolica’s prior written consent.

3.3 Symbolica may grant you access to a private GitHub repository or other hosting for the Licensed Work. You must respect any access controls, confidentiality notices, or usage guidelines provided with that repository or hosting.

4. Your Own Code

You retain ownership of the original code, prompts, configurations, and other content you create using the Licensed Work (“Your Code”).

However:

(a) if Your Code depends on or includes the Licensed Work, you may only use and distribute that combined work in accordance with the Non-Commercial Academic Use restriction above; and  
(b) you are responsible for ensuring that any separate licences applicable to third-party components you use are complied with.

5. No Sublicensing of Simple Agentica

You may not grant any licence to the Licensed Work itself on terms different from this License. Any recipients of copies of the Licensed Work must take their rights directly under this License.

6.2 Symbolica may terminate this License immediately if you materially breach its terms, including by making any commercial use of the Licensed Work.
