Agentica Mini Nixos Showcase
============================

Use `agentica` to fully control a Linux system including:

 -  Installing arbitrary nix packages in the system, for the agent to use.
 -  Enable systemd services and expose their functionality, so the agent can use
    them in the native python environment.
 -  Run arbitrary shell commands to make this all work.
 -  Isolated in QEMU VM
